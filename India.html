        <h1>India is Asia</h1>
        <p>The Republic of India has two principal official short names, each of which is historically significant, India and Bharat. A third name, Hindustan, is also used commonly when Indians speak among themselves. The usage of "Bhārata", "Hindustān", or "India" depends on the context and language of conversation.The name "India" is originally derived from the name of the river Sindhu (Indus River) and has been in use in Greek since Herodotus (5th century BCE). The term appeared in Old English by the 9th century and reemerged in Modern English in the 17th century.</p>
